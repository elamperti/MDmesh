# MD mesh
A simple tool to merge many MarkDown files into one. Useful for documentation.

## Requirements
This tool uses ([markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2)).

## Installation
I made an automatic installer you can run just after you clone it: `setup.sh`. For manual installation take a look at the file.

## Usage
`python mdmesh.py --help` :P

## ToDo
  * Create an internal document queue
  * Follow MarkDown links to other documents
  * Embed CSS into HTML file so it's portable
  * Add argument to use a custom template

## Credits and license
This tool was created by Enrico Lamperti and its distributed under the MIT license.
