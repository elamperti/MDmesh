# MD mesh
A simple tool to merge many MarkDown files into one. Useful for documentation.

## Requirements
This tool uses ([markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2)).

## Installation
I made an automatic installer you can run just after you clone it: `setup.sh`. For manual installation take a look at the file.

## Usage
For quick reference: `python mdmesh.py --help`

## ToDo
  * ~~Create an internal document queue~~ Make a better document queue
  * Allow linking to other documents using absolute paths
  * Add argument to use a custom template
  * Add to this readme how to use the tool

## Credits and license
This tool was created by Enrico Lamperti and its distributed under the MIT license.
